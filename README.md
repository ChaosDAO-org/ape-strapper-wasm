# ape-strapper-wasm
Implementation/translation of 0xTaylor's ApeStrapper Solidity contract into ink!. Ink smart contracts are in their nascency, but soon enough it will be useful to be able to split up regular payments to a group of people on substrate native chains just as ChaosDAO is doing for Moonriver staking on the EVM level.
